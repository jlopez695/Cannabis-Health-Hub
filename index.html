                    The Cannabis Digital Health Information Portal is an online 
                    platform designed to help users explore cannabis-related 
                    digital technologies. The Portal is designed to help users 
                    easily find cannabis-related mobile apps based on their 
                    needs and interests. By organizing and evaluating these 
                    digital tools, we aim to promote informed decision-making, 
                    support responsible cannabis use, and contribute to broader 
                    public health goals. As more individuals turn to mobile 
                    technologies for health and lifestyle guidance, this portal 
                    serves as a trusted entry point into the evolving landscape 
                    of cannabis-related digital resources.
                </p>
                <p class="about-section-text landing-section-text">
                    In its current form, the portal features curated information 
                    about cannabis-related mobile apps, based on findings from a 
                    qualitative research study. Over time, it aims to grow into a 
                    comprehensive resource hub where individuals can discover, 
                    evaluate, and engage with a wide range of cannabis-related 
                    digital tools and resources. The portal is affiliated with 
                    the Cannabis Research Institute and the University of Illinois.
